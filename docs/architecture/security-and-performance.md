# Security and Performance

## Security
*   **Authentication:** Handled by Supabase Auth (JWT-based).
*   **Authorization:** Implemented in the Nest.js GraphQL layer (e.g., using guards).
*   **Data:** All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit by Supabase.
*   **File Uploads:** Supabase Storage will be configured with strict policies to only allow authenticated users to upload specific file types.

## Performance
*   **Frontend:** Next.js SSR and Vercel's edge network will ensure fast initial page loads. Images will be optimized using Next/Image.
*   **Backend:** Nest.js is highly performant. Database queries will be optimized, and caching strategies (e.g., Redis) can be added as needed.
*   **API:** GraphQL allows the frontend to request only the data it needs, reducing payload size.
