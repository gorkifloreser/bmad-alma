# Alma App Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context
**Goals**
*   To be the leading platform for conscious entrepreneurs seeking sustainable and aligned growth.
*   Transform marketing from an exhausting task into a joyful, natural expression of purpose.
*   Achieve high user adoption and retention within the conscious creator niche.
*   Reduce user burnout and increase their sense of brand coherence.

**Background Context**
The Alma App addresses a core conflict faced by conscious creators: the misalignment between their purpose-driven work and the extractive nature of traditional digital marketing. Conventional tools often force them into a "hustle culture" of pressure tactics and vanity metrics, leading to creative burnout. Alma App proposes a "Regenerative Marketing" model, using AI as a conscious assistant to help build magnetic, authentic brands that attract rather than pursue, allowing creators to grow their businesses without sacrificing their soul.

## User Interface Design Goals
**Overall UX Vision**
The user experience must be calm, intuitive, and inspiring, making the process of marketing feel like a creative and nourishing act. The interface should be clean, spacious, and minimalist, avoiding the clutter and urgency of traditional marketing tools. It should feel like a digital sanctuary for the creator's brand.

**Key Interaction Paradigms**
*   **Emotional Design:** The interface will be designed to evoke feelings of calm, creativity, and empowerment. We will use thoughtful micro-interactions, beautiful typography, and a harmonious color palette to create a positive emotional connection.
*   **AI as a Gentle Guide:** AI interactions will be presented as suggestions and drafts, never as final commands. The user is always in the position of the "alchemist," refining and approving the AI's work.
*   **Cyclical Flow:** The UI will guide the user through the regenerative cycle (Reconexión -> Cosecha) in a clear, circular, or step-by-step manner.
*   **Visual & Tactile:** Interactions like the drag-and-drop calendar ("Cosmic Calendar") should be fluid and satisfying.

**Core Screens and Views**
*   **Brand Heart Dashboard (Módulo 1):** Central hub for the brand's soul.
*   **Offerings Catalog (Módulo 2):** Gallery-like view of offerings.
*   **Funnel Builder (Módulo 3):** Visual wizard for user journeys.
*   **Media Orchestrator (Módulo 4):** A strategic dashboard to create and view the holistic content plan.
*   **Content Editor (Módulo 6):** Minimalist, distraction-free editor.
*   **Cosmic Calendar (Módulo 7):** Visual drag-and-drop calendar.
*   **Harvest Dashboard (Módulo 8):** Simple dashboard for testimonial requests.

**Accessibility:** WCAG AA
**Branding:** The branding should be organic, soulful, and minimalist. I'm assuming no specific style guide exists yet, so we will aim for a clean aesthetic with natural tones and elegant typography.
**Target Device and Platforms:** Web Responsive

## Technical Assumptions
**Repository Structure: Monorepo**
*   We will use a monorepo managed with **Turborepo**. This is ideal for a full-stack TypeScript project, as it simplifies code sharing (e.g., for types and validation logic) between the Next.js front-end and the Nest.js back-end.

**Service Architecture: Modular Monolith**
*   The application will be built as a modular monolith to begin with. The back-end (Nest.js) will be well-structured with clear boundaries between modules (e.g., Brand Heart, Offerings, Funnels). This approach provides a simpler development and deployment model initially, while allowing for the potential extraction of modules into separate microservices in the future as the application scales.

**Testing Requirements: Full Testing Pyramid**
*   Our testing strategy will be comprehensive, including:
    *   **Unit Tests:** Jest and React Testing Library (RTL) for the front-end; Jest for the back-end.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Supertest for testing API endpoints on the back-end.
    *   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Cypress for testing critical user flows across the entire application.

**Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests**
*   **Database & Services:** We will leverage Supabase for core services like PostgreSQL database, Authentication, and Storage to accelerate initial development.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform will be used to define and manage our cloud infrastructure, ensuring it is version-controlled and reproducible.
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions will be used to automate our testing and deployment pipelines.
*   **Monitoring & Logging:** Sentry will be used for error monitoring, and Pino for structured logging on the back-end.

## Epic List
*   **Epic 1: Foundation & Brand Heart:** Establish the core project infrastructure, user authentication, and implement the "Brand Heart" (Module 1), allowing users to define their brand's soul.
*   **Epic 2: Offerings & Content Creation:** Implement the "Offerings Catalog" (Module 2) and connect it to the "Creative Studio" (Module 5) and "Artisan's Workshop" (Module 6) to enable AI-powered content generation based on the user's offerings.
*   **Epic 3: Funnels, Strategy & Scheduling:** Develop the "Magic Funnels" (Module 3) to create landing pages, the "Media Orchestrator" (Module 4) to build a content plan, and the "Cosmic Calendar" (Module 7) to schedule the content.
*   **Epic 4: The Harvest Circle & Legacy:** Implement the "Harvest Circle" (Module 8) to manage the post-sale experience and automate the collection of testimonials.
