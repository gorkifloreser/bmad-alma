# Epic 4: The Harvest Circle & Legacy
**Epic Goal:** To complete the regenerative cycle by managing the post-sale experience and transforming customer success stories into new, authentic marketing content. This epic activates the full vision of Module 8.

**Story 4.1: Track "Offering" Delivery (Module 8)**
*   **As a Conscious Creator,** I want a simple dashboard to track the delivery status of my "Offerings", **so that** I can manage my post-sale workflow and know when to engage with my customers.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  A new "Harvest Circle" page is created and is a protected route.
        2.  The page displays a list of recent sales/engagements.
        3.  Each item has a status (e.g., "To Deliver," "In Progress," "Completed").
        4.  The user can manually update the status of each item.

**Story 4.2: Automate Testimonial Requests (Module 8)**
*   **As a Conscious Creator,** I want the platform to automatically ask for a testimonial after an "Offering" is completed, **so that** I can consistently gather social proof without manual effort.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  When an "Offering" is marked as "Completed" on the Harvest Circle dashboard, an automated workflow is triggered.
        2.  The system sends a pre-defined, personalized message via Email or WhatsApp asking for feedback/testimonial.
        3.  The message is based on templates that can be customized by the user in the settings.
        4.  The system waits for a configurable amount of time (e.g., 3 days) after completion before sending the request.

**Story 4.3: Central Testimonial Repository (Module 8)**
*   **As a Conscious Creator,** I want all my collected testimonials to be stored in one central place, **so that** I can easily find and reuse them in my marketing.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  A "Testimonials" tab is available within the "Harvest Circle" page.
        2.  Testimonials received (initially, these will be manually copy-pasted by the user) are stored in a central repository.
        3.  Each testimonial can be tagged with the relevant "Offering".
        4.  The user can easily view, search, and filter all their testimonials.

**Story 4.4: Reseed Content with Testimonials (Module 8 to 5)**
*   **As a Conscious Creator,** I want to be able to turn a powerful testimonial into new marketing content with one click, **so that** I can "reseed" my marketing with authentic stories of transformation.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  In the testimonial repository, each testimonial has a "Create Content from this" button.
        2.  Clicking this button sends the testimonial text to the "Creative Studio" (Module 5).
        3.  The AI generates a new draft social media post that features the testimonial, framed by the user's Brand Heart.
        4.  The new draft appears in the "Artisan's Workshop" (Module 6) for the user to edit and approve.
