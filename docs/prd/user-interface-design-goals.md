# User Interface Design Goals
**Overall UX Vision**
The user experience must be calm, intuitive, and inspiring, making the process of marketing feel like a creative and nourishing act. The interface should be clean, spacious, and minimalist, avoiding the clutter and urgency of traditional marketing tools. It should feel like a digital sanctuary for the creator's brand.

**Key Interaction Paradigms**
*   **Emotional Design:** The interface will be designed to evoke feelings of calm, creativity, and empowerment. We will use thoughtful micro-interactions, beautiful typography, and a harmonious color palette to create a positive emotional connection.
*   **AI as a Gentle Guide:** AI interactions will be presented as suggestions and drafts, never as final commands. The user is always in the position of the "alchemist," refining and approving the AI's work.
*   **Cyclical Flow:** The UI will guide the user through the regenerative cycle (Reconexión -> Cosecha) in a clear, circular, or step-by-step manner.
*   **Visual & Tactile:** Interactions like the drag-and-drop calendar ("Cosmic Calendar") should be fluid and satisfying.

**Core Screens and Views**
*   **Brand Heart Dashboard (Módulo 1):** Central hub for the brand's soul.
*   **Offerings Catalog (Módulo 2):** Gallery-like view of offerings.
*   **Funnel Builder (Módulo 3):** Visual wizard for user journeys.
*   **Media Orchestrator (Módulo 4):** A strategic dashboard to create and view the holistic content plan.
*   **Content Editor (Módulo 6):** Minimalist, distraction-free editor.
*   **Cosmic Calendar (Módulo 7):** Visual drag-and-drop calendar.
*   **Harvest Dashboard (Módulo 8):** Simple dashboard for testimonial requests.

**Accessibility:** WCAG AA
**Branding:** The branding should be organic, soulful, and minimalist. I'm assuming no specific style guide exists yet, so we will aim for a clean aesthetic with natural tones and elegant typography.
**Target Device and Platforms:** Web Responsive
