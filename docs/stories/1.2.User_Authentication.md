# Story 1.2: User Authentication

## Status: Approved

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want to be able to sign up and log in to the platform, **so that** I can access my private brand workspace.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A user can sign up for a new account using an email and password via a clean, simple interface.
2.  A user can log in with their credentials.
3.  A user can log out.
4.  The application has protected routes that are only accessible after a user has logged in.
5.  Authentication is securely handled using Supabase Auth.
6.  The sign-up and log-in experience feels welcoming and calming, not like a typical corporate form.

## Dev Notes
### UI/UX - The Hero's Journey Begins
*   **Emotional Design:** This is the user's first step into the world of Alma. The design should be exceptionally clean, beautiful, and reassuring. Avoid any language that creates pressure or urgency.
*   **Gamification:** The "Welcome" screen after the first sign-up is an opportunity for a celebratory micro-interaction, marking the start of their journey.
