# Story 1.4: Define Brand Heart with Guided Form

## Status: Approved

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want a guided form to input the core elements of my brand's soul, **so that** the AI has a deep understanding of my essence for all future content creation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A dedicated "Brand Heart" page is created and is a protected route.
2.  The page contains a form with fields for key brand elements (e.g., Mission, Vision, Values, Tone of Voice).
3.  The user can save the form content, and it is stored in the database.
4.  If a secondary language is configured, the form displays fields for both languages side-by-side.
5.  For each field, an "Auto-translate" button is present.
6.  The saved brand essence is displayed clearly on the page after being saved.
7.  Completing this step for the first time triggers a celebratory animation, visually representing the "Regenerative Cycle" on the dashboard.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Build "Brand Heart" Page and Form (AC: 1, 2, 4, 5)**
    - [ ] Create the `Brand Heart` page component.
    - [ ] Implement the form with beautiful, expressive MUI components.
    - [ ] Add the auto-translate functionality.
- [ ] **Task 2: Implement Backend Logic (AC: 3, 6)**
    - [ ] Create the `BrandHeart` module and GraphQL mutation in the Nest.js backend.
    - [ ] Implement the save and fetch logic for the user's Brand Heart.
- [ ] **Task 3: Implement Gamification Element (AC: 7)**
    - [ ] On first successful save, trigger a state update that activates a celebratory animation on the main dashboard.
    - [ ] This will be the first step in visualizing the user's progress through the "Regenerative Cycle".

## Dev Notes
### UI/UX - The Initiation
*   **Hero's Journey:** Frame this page as the "initiation" or "crossing the threshold." The language used should be inspiring.
*   **Emotional Design:** The form should not feel like a chore. Use progressive disclosure to reveal one section at a time, making it feel manageable and reflective.
