# Story 1.5: Define Brand Heart with Document Upload

## Status: To Do

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want to be able to upload existing documents about my brand, **so that** the AI can analyze them to automatically understand my brand's essence.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  On the "Brand Heart" page, there is an option to upload documents (e.g., PDF, DOCX).
2.  Uploaded files are securely stored using Supabase Storage.
3.  The user can see a list of their uploaded documents.
4.  (MVP) The system saves a reference to these documents for future analysis; full RAG processing will be implemented in a later story.
