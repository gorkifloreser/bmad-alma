# Story 2.2: Add Contextual Notes to "Offerings"

## Status: Approved

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want to add special notes to my "Offerings", **so that** the AI can understand the specific context for a marketing campaign (e.g., "pre-sale discount," "for beginners," "limited spots").

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  When creating or editing an "Offering", there is a dedicated field for "Contextual Notes".
2.  The user can add free-text notes to this field.
3.  These notes are saved and associated with the specific "Offering".
4.  The notes are clearly visible when viewing the details of an "Offering".
