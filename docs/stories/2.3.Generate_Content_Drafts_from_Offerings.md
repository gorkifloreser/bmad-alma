# Story 2.3: Generate Content Drafts from "Offerings"

## Status: Approved

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want to select one of my "Offerings" and have the AI generate a social media post for it, **so that** I can quickly create marketing content that is aligned with my brand.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  On the detail page for a specific "Offering", there is a "Generate Content" button.
2.  Upon clicking, the AI generates a draft social media post.
3.  The UI frames this interaction as "inviting the muse" or a similar creative concept.
4.  A beautiful loading animation is displayed while the AI is "thinking".

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Add "Generate Content" UI (AC: 1, 3)**
    - [ ] Add a "Invite the Muse" button to the "Offering Detail" page.
- [ ] **Task 2: Create Backend AI Service (AC: 2)**
    - [ ] Implement the `generateContentForOffering` GraphQL mutation.
- [ ] **Task 3: Implement Frontend Logic (AC: 2, 4)**
    - [ ] Call the mutation on button click.
    - [ ] Design and implement a custom loading animation that is on-brand (e.g., a blooming flower, a celestial animation).
    - [ ] Display the generated draft in the "Artisan's Workshop" modal.

## Dev Notes
### UI/UX - Co-Creating with the Muse
*   **Hero's Journey:** The user is now calling on their allies (the AI).
*   **Emotional Design:** The loading state is a key moment. It should feel magical and full of potential, not like a frustrating wait. The AI's output should be presented as a "gift" or "inspiration."
