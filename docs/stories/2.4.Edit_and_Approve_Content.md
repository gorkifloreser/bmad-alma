# Story 2.4: Edit and Approve Content

## Status: Approved

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want to edit the AI-generated draft and approve it, **so that** I have final control over my message and can add my personal touch.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  The generated content draft is displayed within a simple, intuitive editor ("The Artisan's Workshop").
2.  The user can modify the text of the draft.
3.  If bilingual, the user can easily switch between or see both language versions to edit them.
4.  An "Approve" button saves the content and marks its status as "Approved".
5.  Approved content is stored in the database, ready for scheduling in the next epic.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Create the "Artisan's Workshop" Editor (AC: 1, 2, 3)**
    - [ ] Create a new component for the content editor. This could be a full-screen modal or a dedicated page.
    - [ ] Use a rich text editor library (e.g., TipTap, Slate.js) or a simple MUI `TextField` for the editing interface.
    - [ ] If the content is bilingual, design a UI to easily switch between the two versions or view them side-by-side.
- [ ] **Task 2: Implement Backend for Content Approval (AC: 4, 5)**
    - [ ] Create a new module in the Nest.js app for `Content`.
    - [ ] Define the `Content` data model/entity based on the architecture.
    - [ ] Implement a GraphQL mutation (e.g., `approveContent`) that takes the final content text and the associated `offering_id`.
    - [ ] The resolver should create a new `Content` record with the status "Approved".
- [ ] **Task 3: Frontend Approval Logic (AC: 4)**
    - [ ] When the "Approve" button is clicked in the editor, call the `approveContent` mutation with the edited content.
    - [ ] Upon successful approval, close the editor view and show a confirmation message.

## Dev Notes
### Data Model: Content
*   **Purpose:** A piece of marketing content generated by the AI.
*   **Key Attributes:** `id`, `offering_id`, `content_body` (bilingual), `status` (Draft, Approved, Scheduled), `scheduled_at`.
*   **Relationships:** Belongs to an Offering.

### UI/UX
*   The editor should be minimalist and distraction-free, aligning with the "Emotional Design" principle.
