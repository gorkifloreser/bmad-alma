# Story 3.2: View and Edit the Landing Page

## Status: Approved

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want to view and edit the AI-generated landing page in a simple visual editor, **so that** I can ensure it perfectly represents my "Offering".

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  The generated landing page is displayed in a simple, visual drag-and-drop editor.
2.  The user can edit the text content and reorder pre-defined content blocks (e.g., Header, Body, CTA).
3.  The landing page includes the configured CTA (email capture form or WhatsApp button).
4.  The user can save their changes.
5.  A unique, shareable URL is generated for the landing page.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Integrate Puck Editor (AC: 1, 2)**
    - [ ] Add the `@puckeditor/core` and `@puckeditor/react` dependencies to the `web` application.
    - [ ] Create a new "Funnel Builder" page component that wraps the Puck editor.
    - [ ] Configure the editor with the initial data generated in the previous story.
- [ ] **Task 2: Create Custom MUI Components for Puck (AC: 2)**
    - [ ] In the `packages/ui` directory, create a set of simple, brand-aligned components for use in the editor (e.g., `HeadingBlock`, `TextBlock`, `CtaBlock`).
    - [ ] These components should be configurable within the Puck editor interface.
- [ ] **Task 3: Implement Save and Publish Logic (AC: 4, 5)**
    - [ ] Create a GraphQL mutation in the backend to update the landing page content for a funnel.
    - [ ] In the frontend, implement a "Save" button that sends the current Puck editor state to the backend.
    - [ ] The backend should generate a unique public URL for each landing page.
- [ ] **Task 4: Implement CTA Functionality (AC: 3)**
    - [ ] The `CtaBlock` component should have variants for "Email Capture" and "WhatsApp Button".
    - [ ] The Email Capture variant will need a simple form and will integrate with a backend mutation to save leads.
    - [ ] The WhatsApp button will be a simple link.

## Dev Notes
### Technical Decision
*   The visual editor will be implemented using the **Puck** open-source library.
*   Custom components for the editor will be built using **MUI** and shared in the `packages/ui` directory.
