# Story 3.4: Schedule Approved Content on the "Cosmic Calendar"

## Status: Approved

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want to see all my approved content on a calendar and schedule it for publication, **so that** I can have peace of mind that my marketing is automated.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A new "Calendar" page is created and is a protected route.
2.  All content with an "Approved" status appears in an "Unscheduled" sidebar.
3.  The user can drag and drop content from the sidebar onto the calendar.
4.  The drag-and-drop interaction is fluid, beautiful, and satisfying, with clear visual feedback.
5.  Once scheduled, the content's status changes to "Scheduled" and it is displayed on the calendar with a celebratory micro-interaction.

## Dev Notes
### UI/UX - Placing Stars in the Cosmos
*   **Hero's Journey:** The user is manifesting their creations into the world.
*   **Emotional Design:** This interaction is core to the "playful" and "satisfying" experience. The drag-and-drop must feel fluid and tactile. The success feedback should be immediate and delightful.
