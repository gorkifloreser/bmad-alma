# Story 4.1: Track "Offering" Delivery

## Status: Approved

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want a simple dashboard to track the delivery status of my "Offerings", **so that** I can manage my post-sale workflow and know when to engage with my customers.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A new "Harvest Circle" page is created and is a protected route.
2.  The page displays a list of recent sales/engagements.
3.  Each item has a status (e.g., "To Deliver," "In Progress," "Completed").
4.  The user can manually update the status of each item.
5.  The page feels like a sacred, organized space for managing customer relationships, not a cold CRM.

## Dev Notes
### UI/UX - Tending the Garden
*   **Hero's Journey:** This is the "tending and harvesting" phase. The user is nurturing the connections they've made.
*   **Emotional Design:** The UI should feel respectful of the customer relationship. Avoid overly corporate or transactional language. Use icons and colors to convey status in a gentle way.
