# Story 4.4: Reseed Content with Testimonials

## Status: Approved

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want to be able to turn a powerful testimonial into new marketing content with one click, **so that** I can "reseed" my marketing with authentic stories of transformation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  In the testimonial repository, each testimonial has a "Create Content from this" button.
2.  Clicking this button sends the testimonial text to the "Creative Studio".
3.  The AI generates a new draft social media post that features the testimonial.
4.  The new draft appears in the "Artisan's Workshop" for the user to edit and approve.
5.  The UI for this action feels magical and reinforces the "full circle" nature of the journey.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Add "Create Content" UI (AC: 1, 5)**
    - [ ] Add a "Reseed with this Story" button to each testimonial.
    - [ ] The button should have a unique, inspiring icon (e.g., a seed sprouting).
- [ ] **Task 2: Implement Frontend Logic (AC: 2, 4)**
    - [ ] Implement the frontend logic to call the AI service with the testimonial text.
- [ ] **Task 3: Enhance Backend AI Service (AC: 3)**
    - [ ] Enhance the AI service to handle testimonial-based content generation.
- [ ] **Task 4: Add Celebratory Feedback (AC: 5)**
    - [ ] After the new content is generated, display a success message that reinforces the concept of "reseeding," e.g., "A new content seed has been planted in your Artisan's Workshop!"

## Dev Notes
### UI/UX - The Cycle Renews
*   **Hero's Journey:** This is the final step, where the hero brings the "elixir" (the customer's success) back to the community, starting the cycle anew.
*   **Gamification:** This is a key "full circle" moment. The UI should celebrate this action. This completes a loop in the "Regenerative Cycle" visual on the dashboard.
